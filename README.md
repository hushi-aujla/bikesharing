# bikesharing
## Overview
The Tableau story for this module can be found here:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hushi.aujla/viz/bikesharingstory/Story1

The purpose of this project were to analyze bikesharing data from CitiBike in New York City for a presentation to invesors in Des Moines, Iowa to see if a bikesharing program could be useful in their area. In this analysis we will try to discover a few trends in the New York city data that may help the people in Iowa determmine if this trype fo program would be useful to them.
## Result
We will use New York city's citibike data to predict the usefulness of citi bikes in Des Moines, Iowa.

Based on this graph we can see the the vast majority of users have a trip duration of under 20 minutes.

This graph shows that by gender type, all riders still typically have a tripduration of under 20 minutes. This graph also shows that there are much higher number of male riders vs female or unknown gender.

This pie chart also reflects that males are the most common users of CitiBike.

This map shows number of rides based off location. As we can see the most amount of trips occur in the lower part of Manhattan. This area contains a lot of tourists attractions so it is no surprise this area generates more use from CitiBike.

----
![picture alt](https://github.com/hushi-aujla/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips%20by%20Gender.png "Gender and weekday heatmap")
This heatmap shows that the peak hours of rider use are between 6-9am and about 4-8pm, likely the riders are people coming and going to work. This graph also shows that there is less use on weekends compared to regular weekdays. this graph also again that there are usually more male riders.

----
![picture alt](https://github.com/hushi-aujla/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips%20by%20weekday%20per%20Hour.png "Weekday heatmap")

This map again shows the peak hours are from 6-9am and 4-8pm, and again that there is less use during the weekends.

----
![picture alt](https://github.com/hushi-aujla/bikesharing/blob/main/images/user%20trips%20by%20Gender.png "Gender and usertype heatmap"
This heatmap again shows that males are higher users of CitiBike. This map also shows that there are more users that are subscribers as oposed to normal customers, and this is true for all genders

## Summary
Based on this analysis we can tell our investors that the bikesharing service will be more commoly used in areas of heavy traffic and tourism. We can also assume that the majority of riders will be male, and most trips will last under 20 minutes. We can also assume that . We also can expect there will be more use during hours people are getting and leaving to work, and that there will be less use during the weekends. Two additional visualizations that could help us with our analysis could be:
* average trip duration by birthyear and gender, to predict if there is any differences in male and female trip durations as they age.
* if we could collect data from another month like decemeber to see if weather effects the number of rides.
